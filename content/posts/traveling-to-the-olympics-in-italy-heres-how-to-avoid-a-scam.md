Hey there, future Olympic spectator! While athletes are busy perfecting their triple axels and curling techniques, you're probably more focused on getting your travel plans in order for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy. But before you start packing your bags and practicing your “Go Team!” chants, let's talk about something less glamorous but equally important: avoiding travel scams!

### Travel Documents? Keep Your Eye on the Ball!

If you're an American citizen planning a short stay (less than 90 days) in Italy, breathe easy—you don’t need a travel visa. However, if you’re planning on extending your stay (because who can resist gelato and gondolas?), you’ll need a visa. But beware! The cyber-scam Olympics are in full swing with copycat websites posing as official government sites, offering to "help" you with those pesky travel documents for a hefty fee. Spoiler alert: these services are often free or cheaper through official channels. So, stick with the U.S. Department of State’s official website for accurate info and keep your wallet safe!

### Tickets to the Games: Not All Are Winners

When it comes to scoring tickets to the Olympics, don’t get benched by a scam. Remember, ticket re-sellers or brokers are not authorized to sell tickets for the 2026 Winter Olympics. If you spot tickets floating around on sites other than the official Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics website, you're looking at a scam so big it might as well have its own opening ceremony. Stick to the official site, and you'll be cheering from the stands, not from your couch!

### Vacation Rentals: Spot the Fake Listings

Finding a cozy place to crash after a day of Olympic excitement? Be careful! Scammers are sneaky enough to copy legitimate rental listings, swapping out contact information so you reach them instead of the real landlord. Worse yet, they might even invent listings for magical places that don’t exist. Before you send any money, make sure to verify listings through reliable vacation rental platforms, and never wire money or send cash before confirming the legitimacy of the rental. Remember, a little research can save you from a nightmare that's scarier than a luge track!

### See a Scam? Report It!

If you do stumble upon a scam, don’t just shrug it off. Report it! The Federal Trade Commission is the place to go—head over to [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov) and make your voice heard. It's like throwing a red flag on the scam play!

By keeping these tips in mind, you'll be all set to enjoy the Olympics without any unwanted surprises. And remember, while Italy might be known for its pasta and passion, the scammers are all about the dough—your dough. Stay safe, stay smart, and go for the (ticket) gold!
