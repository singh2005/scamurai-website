Hey there, future sports superstar! So you're thinking of taking that leap into the big leagues, or at least snagging some sweet endorsements while in college? Well, before you sign on the dotted line with a sports agent, let's chat about how to keep your eye on the ball and avoid those penalty flags.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is stepping up its game by checking in with universities to make sure sports agents are playing by the rules. Thanks to the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act (SPARTA)—no, not the ancient warriors, but just as fierce—agents must give you and your school the lowdown on any contracts. They also can’t make wild claims like promising you’ll make more money than a lottery winner or offer sneaky gifts to sway your decision.

This week, the FTC sent letters to twenty universities, asking some serious questions about the actions of sports agents on campus. Are these agents handing out contracts with all the details? Alerting schools within 72 hours of a contract signing, or before your next game, whichever comes first? Or are they pulling fast ones by making false promises about endorsement riches, fibbing about past clients, or slipping illegal gifts to athletes or their families?

If you're about to join forces with a sports agent, here are some pro tips to keep you safe:

1. **Keep Your School in the Loop**: As soon as you sign with an agent, give your school the heads-up. While agents are required to notify your school, it's always a good move to double down and make sure everyone’s on the same page.

2. **Phone a Friend (or Family Member)**: Before you commit, run things by someone you trust. Whether it's your mom, dad, or that wise uncle who always knows the best way to grill a burger, they'll help you make sense of the contract, ensure you get all the info SPARTA demands, and keep track of everything.

3. **Report Bad Behavior**: If a sports agent tries to pull a fast one—whether it's a shady promise or a suspiciously generous gift—let the FTC know. You can report your experience anonymously if you prefer, and help keep the sports world fair and square.

Remember, signing with an agent is a big deal, but with the right info and a solid support system, you can make smart decisions and keep your career on track. Now go out there and show them your best moves—but make sure they're all above board!
