### The Not-So-Mysterious Case of the Fake FTC Agent

Imagine this: You're enjoying your day, perhaps sipping on a coffee, when suddenly, your phone rings. The caller ID says it's someone official. Intrigued, you pick up, only to find yourself speaking with "Agent John Krebs" from the FTC. But wait, this isn't an episode of CSI: Cyber. It's a scam!

Here's the scoop: Scammers are dialing folks up, masquerading as noble employees from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), sometimes even name-dropping real FTC roles like the Chief Privacy Officer. But spoiler alert, there's no "Agent" John Krebs, and the FTC doesn't have agents. It's a big fat fib designed to give you the heebie-jeebies and, you guessed it, steal your money!

### The Scam Unveiled

The pretend agent will drop a bombshell: you're supposedly under investigation for money laundering. Gasp! But fear not; it's all bogus. They’ll offer a way out: just deposit some cash at a Bitcoin ATM. Sounds legit, right? Wrong! It’s a scam with a capital S, and the only thing you should be depositing is your phone back on the hook.

### How to Protect Yourself

Here's your handy-dandy guide to avoid getting conned:

1. **Money for Calls? Forget it!** If someone calls you unexpectedly demanding cash, hang up faster than you can say "scam alert." Even if they sound as convincing as your favorite TV detective, don’t fall for it.

2. **No Cash from the FTC**: The real FTC will never ask for your money to resolve issues. In fact, no government agency will demand payment through Bitcoin ATMs, gift cards, or payment apps like Zelle, Cash App, or Venmo. If you hear this, think "scammy scam scam."

3. **Caller ID? More like Caller Lie-D**: Scammers can fake those little numbers on your screen to look like they're from the government. Don't be fooled by a fancy name or number. If in doubt, hang up.

### What to Do If You Get That Call

If you get a call from a supposed "agent," don’t engage. Hang up immediately and don’t even think about calling back. Instead, do your civic duty and report it to the FTC at [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://www.ReportFraud.ftc.gov). Your future self will thank you!

Stay savvy, stay safe, and remember, if it sounds fishy, it probably is!
