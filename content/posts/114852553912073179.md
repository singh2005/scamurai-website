### The Stormy Truth about FEMA Impersonators

Ah, natural disasters. They bring communities together, showcase the resilience of the human spirit, and unfortunately, attract scammers like bees to honey. One of the most common scams involves these cunning tricksters impersonating FEMA officials. They're not here to help; they're here to make it rain... for themselves.

### The FEMA Scam Forecast

Here's the deal: after a severe weather event, these sneaky scammers pretend to be from FEMA, offering disaster grants or home inspections for a fee. Spoiler alert: FEMA doesn’t charge for disaster assistance. If they’re asking for cash up front, it’s a scam. Period.

### Spotting the Fake FEMA Fiasco

1. **Show Me the Money? No Way!**  
   FEMA employees will never, ever—like, ever—ask for money for inspections, debris removal, grants, or assistance with applications. If someone is asking you to fork over cash or your banking info, they're a scammer with a capital "S."

2. **Badge of Dishonor**  
   Sure, FEMA folks wear official badges with their name and photo, but scammers are crafty and can make fake badges or don FEMA-branded attire. If you're suspicious about someone claiming to be from FEMA, just play it cool and call the real FEMA at 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) to verify.

3. **Unwanted Calls or Texts? Red Flag Alert!**  
   If you receive an unsolicited call or text from someone claiming to be from FEMA, and you've never applied for disaster assistance, it's highly likely to be a scam. FEMA only reaches out to those who have contacted them first. And remember, they never text demanding money or personal info.
