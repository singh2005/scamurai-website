Ah, Valentine’s Day. The time of year when lovebirds coo sweet nothings and florists make their annual fortune. But wait! Before you get swept off your feet by that charming online admirer, let's make sure you don't end up in the clutches of a romance scammer. These love bandits are smoother than a Barry White album and could leave you singing the blues. So, how do you spot one? Let's dive in!

**1. The Great Vanishing Act**
First up, if your online sweetheart always has an excuse for why they can't meet you in person, it might be a red flag bigger than a bouquet of roses. They might say they’re in the military, working on an oil rig, or doing business overseas. Oh, the glamorous lives they lead! Or, they'll plan to meet but then cancel more often than a soap opera cliffhanger. 

**2. The Money Honey Trap**
Next, if your digital darling starts asking for money, it's a sign Cupid's arrow might have missed the mark. They'll spin tales of medical emergencies, urgent travel needs, or a financial pickle that only you can solve. But remember, your wallet isn’t a charity for mysterious maladies or spontaneous vacations!

**3. The Payment Puppeteer**
Finally, if they tell you exactly how to send the money, they're not just playing hard to get—they're playing you, period. Scammers suggest sending money via wire transfers, gift cards, payment apps, or even cryptocurrency. Each method is about as retrievable as a chocolate fondue at a toddler's birthday party.

**So, what should you do if you suspect a scammer's got their sights on you?**

- **Cut the Cord**: Stop all contact faster than you’d skip a song by your least favorite artist. Then, chat with someone you trust about the situation. If they're worried too, it's time to hit the brakes.

- **Search and Destroy**: Google their job title along with the word “scammer.” You might find stories from others who've encountered the same dubious character.

- **Picture This**: Do a reverse image search of your paramour’s profile picture. If it pops up under different names or strange details, it's a surefire sign of a scam.
