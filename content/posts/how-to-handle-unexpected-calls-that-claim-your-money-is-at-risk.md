**Does your phone ring and the caller’s words send you into a tailspin?** They claim there’s fraud on your credit card, your bank account has been hacked, you owe a tax debt, or your benefits are about to vanish into thin air. Yikes! Suddenly, your heart is pounding like a drum solo at a rock concert, and your mind is racing faster than a cheetah on a sugar high. The caller senses your panic and offers help. Should you trust them? Spoiler alert: Absolutely not.

First, breathe. Scammers might know your full name, address, or even your favorite pizza topping, but that doesn’t mean they’re trustworthy. They buy or steal this info to make their lies sound as convincing as your grandma’s tales about walking uphill both ways to school.

### So, what should you do if you get a call like this?

**Step 1: Gather Intel and Hang Up**  
Channel your inner detective—ask which company or bank they claim to represent and what the supposed problem is. Then, in the most polite way possible, hang up. Yes, hang up. It's not rude; it's safe!

**Step 2: Verify Their Tall Tale**  
Do you have an account with the company or bank they mentioned? Time to check it out yourself. But beware! Don’t trust a search engine as far as you can throw it. Scammers love to buy ads to put their fake numbers right at the top. Instead:

- Use the official app or website to contact the fraud department.
- Call the number on your latest statement or the back of your card (that little number isn’t just for decoration!).

**Step 3: Phone a Friend**  
Just like on a game show, when in doubt, phone a friend! No genuine fraud department will ask you to keep their call a secret. If someone does, they're as suspicious as a cat near a spilled milk jug.

**Golden Rule: Keep Your Secrets**  
Never, and we mean NEVER, share your personal or account info. Don’t let anyone remotely access your phone or computer, and guard your account verification codes like they’re the last piece of chocolate cake.
