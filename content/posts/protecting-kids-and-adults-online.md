In a plot twist that sounds like it came straight out of a daytime soap opera, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Utah Division of Consumer Protection have teamed up like a dynamic duo to tackle the darker corners of the internet. Their latest victory? A settlement with Aylo, the company behind over 100 porn sites, including the infamous Pornhub, YouPorn, and Redtube. Why? For distributing some seriously illegal content, including child sex abuse materials and non-consensual images. Yikes!

Here's the scoop: Aylo now has to give you a super simple way to report any illegal content you stumble upon. Think of it as a "see something, say something" button for the internet. Each site will feature a "Content Removal Request" option, where you can flag anything that makes you go, "Wait, is this even legal?" Once you hit that button, Aylo is required to temporarily suspend the content. If it's indeed illegal, they have to take it down faster than you can say "inappropriate." And if it involves kids, Aylo will not only ban the culprit but also report the content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Talk about swift justice!

But wait, there's more! If your images have ended up where they shouldn't be, Aylo is now obligated to provide you with a case manager. Yes, an actual human being to help you navigate the murky waters of content removal. They'll keep you in the loop about the process so you won’t be left in the dark wondering if your nightmare is ever going to end.

For the FTC, getting rid of illegal sexually explicit materials is kind of a big deal. They're rolling up their sleeves and getting ready to enforce parts of the Take It Down Act starting May 2026. While they're on the civil enforcement side, the Department of Justice will be handling the criminal stuff. It's like a buddy cop movie, but with a lot more paperwork.

So, what should you do in the meantime? Protect your online privacy like it’s made of gold. And if you suspect that Aylo or any other website is stepping on your digital rights, don’t just sit there fuming—report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Stay vigilant, internet warriors!
