Oh, telemarketing calls. No one asked for them, yet they persist like a bad case of hiccups. One moment you're enjoying your day, and the next, your phone's ringing with someone trying to sell you a miracle mop or a subscription box for pet rocks. But fear not, we’re here to help you cut down those pesky calls with the precision of a master chef slicing an onion.

### Who's Behind the Calls?

Sometimes, telemarketing calls are as random as a cat's antics at 3 AM. Other times, they're a little more sinister. Companies often lure you into sharing your information with promises of coupons, sweepstakes, or quotes for products like insurance or warranties. Little do you know, these websites might sell your info faster than you can say "I didn't sign up for this!"

### The Sneaky Sales Call

Here's where the drama unfolds: Companies buy your details from these sites and then launch a barrage of unsolicited calls. You know what that means? Illegal telemarketing calls, folks! If you’re listed on the Do Not Call Registry, these calls are about as legal as your uncle's secret moonshine recipe.

### A Case of Telemarketing Gone Rogue

Let’s spill the tea. Recently, the FTC settled with Citizens Disability, a company that dialed up millions of people about Social Security disability advocacy services. The catch? They bought people's info from websites offering coupons and sweepstakes and then made illegal calls, including robocalls. As if that wasn't enough, they fibbed about responding to people's inquiries regarding Social Security benefits. Naughty, naughty!

### Telemarketing Tango Tips

To waltz away from unwanted telemarketing calls, follow these savvy steps:

- **Guard Your Info Like a Dragon Guards Gold**: Before typing your details into a website, run a quick search with the site's name plus “complaint,” “review,” or “scam.” It's like checking the fridge before buying milk—better safe than sorry.

- **Report Robocalls**: Got a robocall? Report it faster than you can hang up at DoNotCall.gov.

- **Stay Informed**: Many robocalls are scams in disguise. For the latest scoop, visit ftc.gov/robocalls.

- **Trust the Registry**: If you’re on the Do Not Call Registry, you shouldn’t receive sales calls from companies you're not involved with. Period.
