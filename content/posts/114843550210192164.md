Hey there, fellow safety-savvy citizens! Today, we’re diving into a topic that's as serious as your aunt's mystery casserole at family gatherings—public safety. Recently, there have been some scary incidents affecting Jewish and Israeli communities, and it’s important for all of us to stay informed and vigilant. Let’s break it down.

### What’s Happening?

The FBI and DHS (those are the folks who are really good at keeping us safe) have issued a public safety announcement. Why? Well, there have been some unsettling attacks. In early June, a person decided to crash a pro-Israel gathering in Boulder, Colorado, with Molotov cocktails—definitely not the party favor anyone asked for. Nine people were injured. Just before that, two Israeli Embassy staffers were tragically shot after an event in Washington, DC.

These violent acts are tied to ongoing tensions in the Israel-HAMAS conflict. The fear is that extremists and hate crime perpetrators might seize the opportunity to conduct similar attacks against Jewish and Israeli communities or their supporters. Yikes!

### What Should You Do?

Now, don’t panic. We’re not here to hide under our beds, but to stay aware and take action when needed. Here’s how you can contribute to community safety:

- **Stay Vigilant:** Keep your eyes peeled for any suspicious activity. It could be as simple as someone acting sketchy or leaving a package behind. Trust your instincts!

- **Report Suspicious Activity:** Don’t be shy! If you see something, say something. You can report tips to the FBI at [tips.fbi.gov](https://tips.fbi.gov) or contact your local FBI field office. They’re like the superheroes waiting for your call.

- **Call 911 for Emergencies:** If you ever find yourself in a situation where there’s an immediate threat to life, dial those three magic numbers—911. They’ll get help to you faster than you can say “emergency.”

- **Look Out for Friends Abroad:** Got friends or family living or traveling internationally? If you’re worried about their safety, you can contact the Department of State’s Overseas Citizens Services at (888) 407-4747 or fill out the Crisis Intake Form at [https://cacms.state.gov/s/crisis-intake](https://cacms.state.gov/s/crisis-intake).

### The Takeaway

While it might feel daunting, staying informed and alert can make a huge difference. Think of yourself as a community safety champion—no cape required! By looking out for one another and reporting anything suspicious, you’re helping to keep everyone safe. And hey, that’s something to be proud of!

Remember, the key to safety is staying informed, staying calm, and taking action when needed. Together, we can keep our communities safe and sound.
