Picture this: You're casually living your best life when *bam!* – a voicemail from a mystery caller reminds you about a $52,000 loan application you never made. Spoiler alert: It's a scam! But hey, no worries. Let’s laugh in the face of danger and arm ourselves with the know-how to dodge these crafty crooks.

Here’s how the scam goes down: You get an unexpected call from someone claiming you’re “prequalified” for a loan. Plot twist: you aren't. These tricky callers want you to spill your personal secrets like your Social Security number, bank account digits, or even your birth date. They might spin a tale about an almost-complete application that just needs a smidge more info. Spoiler: still not true. They'll sprinkle in phrases like “I hope you don’t miss out” or “no pressure” to speed up your decision-making. (Translation: "Hurry up and fall into our trap!")

And if you get a voicemail, they might offer to take you off their call list if you ring them back. Spoiler: Another sneaky tactic!

What’s their master plan? To bombard you with calls from different numbers, hoping you'll eventually cave in. But here’s your anti-scam battle plan:

1. **Never call back.** Seriously, resist the urge! Returning the call could open the floodgates to even more scammy shenanigans.

2. **Don’t trust caller ID.** Scammers have a magical ability to spoof numbers, making them look local or even like your trusted neighborhood government office. Spoiler: They aren't.

3. **Block that number!** Dive into your phone's settings, app store, or your phone provider’s website to discover call-blocking or labeling services. If any scam calls sneak through, they'll likely show up as “spam” or “scam likely” on your screen. Warning: “scam likely” is not your new best friend.

4. **Report them!** Unwanted calls cramping your style? Report them to the FTC at [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov). Don’t forget to include the numbers that appear on your caller ID and any sneaky return-call numbers they give you.

For a visual pep talk, check out a video on how to stop these pesky calls on your cell phone. And remember, the next time a scammer calls, you’ve got the knowledge to hang up with flair.
