Move over Valentine’s Day, February’s real highlight is National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW)! 🎉 From March 1st to 7th, 2026, it's time to trade in chocolates for savvy consumer skills. Here's your guide to becoming a scam-busting superhero.

### NCPW Prep 101: How to Be a Consumer Protection Pro

**1. Bookmark ftc.gov/ncpw Like It’s Hot**

This is your hub for all things NCPW. Think of it as the ultimate party planning committee, but instead of balloons and cake, you'll find social media graphics, messages, and top-secret tips to elevate your consumer protection game. Keep hitting refresh for updates on virtual and in-person events that are sure to be the talk of the consumer town.

**2. Get Those Freebies!**

Hosting an NCPW event? Want to hand out cool resources on avoiding frauds and scams like a pro? Head over to Bulkorder.ftc.gov and order your stash of print materials by February 6th. They ship free because who doesn’t love free stuff? Especially when it helps you dodge scams!

**3. Webinar Wonders**

Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned NCPW veteran, these webinars will turn you into the James Bond of consumer protection. Mark your calendar for February 5th at 2 pm ET and February 25th at 12 pm ET for a special session co-hosted by the New York Public Library (because books and scam-stopping are a perfect pair).

**4. Subscribe, Baby!**

Stay ahead of the scam curve by subscribing to Consumer Alerts. It’s like having a personal assistant who whispers the latest scam gossip directly into your ear. Plus, you'll get updates on NCPW events and resources, making you the most informed person at your next virtual water cooler chat.

**5. Stay Socially Connected**

Follow the FTC on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter for those keeping score), and Instagram. Because who doesn’t want to scroll through scam-busting content while avoiding their relatives' vacation photos?

Now that you’re armed with all the tools to tackle NCPW, get out there and be the hero your wallet deserves. Remember, knowledge is power, and a well-informed consumer is a scammer’s worst nightmare.
