Hello, internet navigators! Today, we're diving into a topic that's both serious and surprisingly sneaky: finding legitimate help for substance use disorders online. Spoiler alert: not everyone on the internet has your best interests at heart. Shocking, right? 

August 31 is International Overdose Awareness Day—a day dedicated to remembering those lost to overdose, supporting their families, and taking action to end these tragedies. One way the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is stepping up is by tackling the not-so-nice folks who try to scam those seeking treatment. So, let’s break down how not to get hoodwinked while searching for help.

**The Search Engine Shenanigans**

Picture this: you're searching online for a treatment clinic. You type in the name of a center, and BAM!—a bunch of results pop up. But here’s the kicker: those top results might be paid ads. Yes, folks, money talks on the internet highway.

Sometimes, shady businesses pay to appear at the top of search results using the names of real treatment centers. Crafty, right? But instead of connecting you with the actual center, they sneakily slip in their own contact info. You call, thinking you're reaching the real deal, and end up talking to an imposter. Yikes!

**How to Outsmart the Scammers**

1. **Be a Detective**: When you have a specific treatment clinic in mind, scrutinize the search results. Look closely before clicking on any ads or punching in any numbers.

2. **Do Your Homework**: Before handing over your hard-earned cash or personal info, dig deeper into any program or center you find. Make sure it's legit!

3. **Know Where to Go**: For real help close to you, start your journey at [FindTreatment.gov](https://www.findtreatment.gov/). It’s like a treasure map to genuine treatment options.

**Caught a Scammer?**

If you stumble upon a business that's up to no good, don’t just shake your fist at the screen—report it! Head over to [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) and let the FTC know. You’ll be doing your part to clean up the web.

**Spread the Word**

Got a friend or family member who might benefit from this info? Share the knowledge (and this blog post!) on your social media. The more people know, the less power these scam artists have.
