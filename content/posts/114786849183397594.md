Hey, soldier! We know you've got our backs, but who's got yours when it comes to dodging those tricky scams? You'd be surprised how many folks don't even realize they're being scammed until their wallet starts feeling lighter than a feather. In 2024 alone, military consumers reported losing a whopping $584 million to fraud! That's enough to buy a fleet of tanks—or, you know, a really fancy coffee machine for the barracks.

But fear not, because the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is here to help you spot, avoid, and report scams like a pro. They've got your six with some top-notch advice to keep you and your battle buddies scam-free.

### Scam-Spotting 101: Tactical Tips

1. **The Phantom Text Attack**: Next time you're in a battalion huddle, share a tale of a mysterious text about a "problem" with an online order or some phantom money you supposedly owe. Scammers love sending these surprise messages to snatch your personal info and cash. Remember, if it sounds fishy, it probably is!

2. **The Social Media Siege**: Before you deploy, give your loved ones the 411 on those sneaky scammers lurking on social media. They send urgent messages about fake emergencies or too-good-to-be-true investment offers. Spoiler alert: They're trying to reel you in like a fish on a line.

3. **The Slow Down Strategy**: Tell the older veterans in your community to take it easy before responding to unexpected calls or emails. Only scammers demand you pay in specific ways, like cryptocurrency, wiring money, using a payment app, or—my personal favorite—gift cards. Because nothing screams "professional" like a payment in iTunes gift cards, right?

4. **The Money Recovery Mission**: Know someone who got bamboozled into paying a scammer? Guide them on how to attempt a cash comeback. Every dollar saved is another dollar for that post-deployment pizza party.

5. **Weekly Intel Briefs**: Check out MilitaryConsumer.gov/MCM2025 every week in July for graphics, blogs, and social media messages. It's like a treasure trove of scam-busting knowledge waiting to be shared with your crew.

And remember, reporting scams to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov helps protect others and makes you a hero in the fight against fraud.

So, stay sharp out there, and don't let the scammers win. Keep your eyes peeled, your wallets secure, and your gift cards out of sight.
