Have you ever received an email or text that screams, "You're out of storage space!" with the urgency of a toddler who just found out bedtime is non-negotiable? It seems legit, right? After all, the message claims to be from Apple, Microsoft, or Google. But before you panic and start deleting all those cute cat videos from your phone, let's make sure you're not about to fall into a scammer's trap.

**Suspicious Storage Alerts: A Scam Detector Guide**

First things first: if you're getting notifications about cloud storage from a company you don't even use, that's a red flag waving so high it might as well be a semaphore for "PHISHING SCAM!" Delete that email faster than a spammer can say "click here."

But what if the message is from a company you actually use? Well, don't just click the link like you're playing a game of digital whack-a-mole. Instead, channel your inner detective and take these savvy steps:

1. **Contact the Company Directly**: Use a contact method that you know and trust. That could mean visiting their official website or using their real customer service number. This way, you can check if your cloud is truly about to burst like a birthday balloon.

2. **Log Into Your Account**: Head directly to your cloud storage account through your browser or app. If there's an issue, you'll see it there without the risk of being led astray by a phishing link.

3. **Be Skeptical of Links**: Scammers are like digital magicians, crafting emails that look as official as a royal decree. Their ultimate trick? Making you click a link that could steal your info or install malware faster than you can say "abracadabra!"

**What to Do If You Smell a Scam**

- **Email Fishiness**: Got a suspicious email? Forward it to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org. They love tackling phish, no bait needed.

- **Text Trickery**: If text messages are the culprit, report them on your messaging app or forward that text to SPAM (7726). Think of it as sending those scammers to digital detention.

- **Report to the FTC**: Phishing attempts can be shared with the Federal Trade Commission at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Consider them your superhero squad against scammy villains.

Remember, knowledge is your best defense against phishing attacks. Arm yourself with awareness and you'll be prepared to spot and squash scams like a pro.
