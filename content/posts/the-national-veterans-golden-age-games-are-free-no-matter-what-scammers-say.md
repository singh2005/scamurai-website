Attention, veterans and couch potatoes alike! If you’re itching to throw a javelin or cheer from the sidelines at the upcoming National Veterans Golden Age Games, watch where you click! The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is hosting these games, and they cost you *zero* dollars to join. But some sneaky scammers are trying to cash in on your enthusiasm with fake registration sites. Don’t let them take you for a ride!

**Here’s the real deal:**

The Golden Age Games are all about bringing our cherished veterans together for a bit of fun and fitness. The VA is the official host, and you can only register through the one and only official website, VA.gov, using your trusty ID.me account. If you stumble upon any sketchy social media posts or websites asking for registration fees, run faster than a sprinter on espresso—because those are fakes!

**Top Tips to Dodge Scams:**

1. **Only Use VA.gov:** If you’re gearing up to register, head straight to VA.gov. It’s the mothership for all your veteran benefits, and the only safe place to sign up for the games. Keep your ID.me account polished and up-to-date, so the VA knows it’s really you and not some cyber trickster.

2. **Never Pay a Penny:** If anyone says you need to cough up money to register or even watch the games, laugh in their scamming face and walk away. VA events are like hugs from grandma—warm, welcoming, and free!

3. **Guard Your VA Credentials:** Your credentials are like your secret superhero identity. Keep them under wraps! Scammers can use your information to swipe your identity or your benefits.

Got burning questions about the games? Reach out to the VA at GoldenAgeGames@Va.Gov. And if you sniff out a scam, report it faster than you can say "fraud" at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

Stay savvy, stay safe, and may your javelin always land in the bullseye!
