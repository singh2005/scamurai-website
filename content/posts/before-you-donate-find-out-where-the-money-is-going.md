Alright, folks, let's talk about something we all love—a good cause! But what if I told you not every charity is as charitable as it seems? Get ready for a tale of deception, car donations, and a charity that apparently thought "breast cancer screenings" were just a suggestion.

**Kars-R-Us.com: The Charity That Wasn't**

Once upon a time, Kars-R-Us.com, Inc. was a charity that just wanted to help fight breast cancer. Or so they said. According to the FTC, this group raised millions through ads on TV, radio, and online, all in the name of the United Breast Cancer Foundation (UBCF). They promised their car donations would "save lives" by funding free or low-cost breast cancer screenings. 

But here's the kicker: Out of the $45.5 million raised between 2017 and 2022, less than 1% went to actual screenings. That's right, less than 1%! The rest probably went to a secret stash of pink ribbons or maybe a really fancy office coffee machine. Who knows?

**How to Spot a Charity Scam**

Before you donate your hard-earned cash—or your beloved old car that’s been rusting in the driveway—here are some tips to avoid being taken for a ride:

1. **Do Your Homework**: Research the charity’s name alongside words like “complaint,” “review,” “rating,” or “scam.” Trust me, Google is your BFF here. You can also check out organizations that specialize in researching charities.

2. **Safe Payment Methods**: Stick to checks or credit cards. If a charity asks you to pay via wiring money, cryptocurrency, payment app, or a gift card, that’s a red flag. Seriously, when was the last time a legit charity asked for a donation through Bitcoin or a Starbucks gift card?

3. **Check the Website**: A legitimate charity will have detailed information about how your donation supports their programs. If they don’t, it’s time to say, “Bye, Felicia!” and find another charity.

**What to Do If You Spot a Scam**

If you stumble upon a charity scam, do your good deed for the day and report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Not only will you be helping protect yourself, but you'll also be saving others from falling into the same trap.

Remember, folks, charity is about helping those in need, not funding a scammer’s luxurious lifestyle. So, keep your eyes peeled and your donations honest!
