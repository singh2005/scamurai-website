Hey, neighbor! Imagine waking up one morning, stretching, yawning, and realizing someone’s made off with your favorite garden gnome. Shocking, right? Well, identity theft is kind of like that, except they're not just taking your gnome—they're after your entire financial persona! Last year, over a million folks found themselves in this digital horror movie. But don’t worry, Identity Theft Awareness Week is here to save the day!

Mark your calendars for January 26-30, 2026, because the FTC is rolling out the red carpet for Identity Theft Awareness Week (IDTAW). Get ready to lock arms (and your credit) with the best of them. Here’s how you can join the fun and keep your identity safe from sticky fingers!
