Hey there, savvy internet user! Are you ready to level up your scam-busting skills? Criminals are getting craftier, using tactics that might even make the sneakiest cartoon villains jealous. But don't worry, we've got your back! Let's dive into some practical tips to keep those pesky scammers at bay, especially when it comes to unsolicited packages and QR codes.

### The Mystery Package Problem

Ever received a package and thought, "Wait, did I order this in a sleep-deprived online shopping spree?" Before you start thinking you've got a secret admirer, consider this: it might be a scam! 

**Warning Signs:**
- You didn't order it. It's like the universe's way of saying, "Surprise! But not the good kind."
- There's no sender information. It's the package equivalent of a ghosting text.

**Pro Tip:** If you suspect something fishy, don't ignore it. Change your account profiles and grab a free credit report from Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. It's like giving your financial health a yearly check-up—no awkward small talk required.

### The QR Code Quandary

QR codes are everywhere—menus, ads, and even mysterious packages. But beware of scanning codes from unknown origins. Scanning a rogue QR code can lead to unauthorized access to your data faster than you can say, "Oops!"

**Safety First:** 
- Be skeptical of unsolicited QR codes. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
- Before granting phone permissions or accessing any new apps or sites, take a moment. Consider it your digital "look both ways before crossing the street."

### When in Doubt, Report It Out

If you think you've been targeted by these scams, it's time to channel your inner detective and report it. Head over to the [FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center](www.ic3.gov) and spill the beans with as much info as you can muster. The more details, the better!

**For Our Wise Elders (60+):** Need help with this digital sleuthing? The DOJ Elder Justice Hotline is here for you at 1-833-FRAUD-11. Because who says you can't teach an old dog new scam-busting tricks?

Remember, staying safe online doesn't have to be a daunting task. With a sprinkle of caution and a dash of vigilance, you can outsmart those cyber scoundrels in style.
