Hey there, wanderlust warriors and globe-trotting troopers! If you’re a servicemember, you’re no stranger to packing up and setting sail to a new adventure every few years. But with every new destination, there comes the chaos of breaking leases, selling cars, and redirecting mail—all while trying to keep your personal info safe from those pesky scammers lurking in the shadows.

Fear not! We've got the ultimate guide to help you protect your sensitive info while you plan your next move. Think of it as your trusty shield against the dark arts of scamming.

### 1. Update Your Tech Shields!

First things first, make sure your computer and phone are equipped with the latest security patches. Set them to automatically install updates because, let’s face it, who has time to remember that stuff when you’re knee-deep in cardboard boxes?

### 2. Guard Your Precious Documents

Keep your financial records and sensitive documents locked up tighter than a dragon's hoard. When it’s time to let them go, shred them like they’re secret spy documents. And don’t forget to forward your mail through the United States Postal Service to your new address. You don’t want your mail going on its own adventure.

### 3. Social Security Number: A Need-to-Know Basis

Your Social Security number is more classified than top-secret intel. Only share it when absolutely necessary. If someone asks for it, channel your inner detective: Why do they need it? What's gonna happen to it?

### 4. Pre-Move Credit Armor

Before you hit the road or catch that flight, consider freezing your credit. It’s like putting a padlock on your credit report, making it less enticing to scammers. Bonus points for placing an active duty fraud alert on your report and signing up for free credit monitoring. Because who doesn’t love a little extra protection?

### 5. Keep an Eye on Your Financial Footprints

While traveling, keep a vigilant eye on your credit card bills and bank statements. If you spot transactions you didn’t make, it’s time to raise the alarm. And don’t forget to check your free credit reports at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com). Look for any suspicious activity, like accounts you don’t remember opening.

### 6. Battle Plan for Identity Theft

If identity theft crashes your party, don’t panic! Report it and get a personal recovery plan at [IdentityTheft.gov](https://www.identitytheft.gov). Consider it your battle plan to reclaim your identity.

So, there you have it—your guide to safeguarding your personal info while making your next move. Safe travels, and may your moves be smooth and scam-free!
