The snow has settled, the wind has calmed, and the power is (hopefully) back on. But wait, what’s that lurking in the shadows of the post-blizzard landscape? It’s those pesky scammers, ready to pounce! Just as you’re warming up from the storm, they’re turning up the heat with schemes as slippery as an ice-covered sidewalk. Let’s make sure you don’t fall for their frosty tricks.

### The Stormy Scam Forecast: What to Watch For

1. **Suspicious Messages**: If you open your inbox to find an email or text claiming to be from your utility company, complete with a link to click, take a deep breath and step away from the mouse. Scammers are pros at whipping up messages that look legit but are actually designed to swipe your personal info. Instead of taking the bait, hop on the phone and call your utility company using the number on your bill. Verify before you trust!

2. **Odd Payment Requests**: If someone tells you to pay via money transfer, gift cards, or cryptocurrency, you’ve got a scam alert on your hands. No legit utility company is going to ask you to pay in Bitcoin or with those leftover gift cards from Aunt Edna. Hold tight to your cash and report such requests immediately.

3. **Too-Good-to-Be-True Repairs**: The aftermath of a storm often brings out the unlicensed contractors and scammers promising the moon and the stars. If someone is demanding cash up front or refusing to show you their license and insurance, it’s time to show them the door. Remember, a little skepticism now will save you a lot of headaches later.
