Hello, generous souls! It seems Mother Nature decided to make a splash in central Texas, and while many of us are eager to help, some sneaky scammers are rubbing their hands with glee. But fear not! We're here to guide you through making sure your donations reach those in need and not some villainous bank account.

### Charity Begins at (a Trusted) Home

First things first, stick with charities you know and trust. We're talking the A-team of disaster relief — organizations with a proven track record of actually helping people, not just helping themselves to your money. Before you click 'donate,' do a little detective work. Check out the charity on Better Business Bureau’s [Give.org](https://www.give.org) or [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org). And don't stop there! Find out how much of your hard-earned cash actually goes to the cause.

### Payment Methods: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

Scammers love cash, gift cards, wire transfers, and cryptocurrency like cats love laser pointers. If someone insists on these forms of payment, it's time to channel your inner Sherlock and get suspicious. When in doubt, stick to donating via credit card — it’s like a superhero cape for your transactions, offering more protection against fraud.

### Crowdfunding: Proceed with Caution

Crowdfunding can be a fantastic way to help, but it's not without its pitfalls. Remember, the money goes to the campaign organizer, not directly to the people or cause. Before donating, familiarize yourself with the platform’s policies. Do they verify posts asking for disaster relief? Also, note that while your heart may grow three sizes, your tax deductions won't, as crowdfunding donations aren't tax-deductible.

### Texting to Donate: Confirm Before You Commit

Texting to donate is oh-so-convenient, but it can also be a trap. Always confirm the number by visiting the charity's official website. A mix-up here could mean your donation ends up funding some scammer's beach vacation instead of helping flood victims.
