Attention, honor-bound guardians of justice and defenders of freedom! While you're out there protecting the world, who’s protecting you from the stealthy scammers lurking in the shadows outside military banks? These crooks have devised a cunning plan to march off with your hard-earned cash, and today, we're here to brief you on how to dodge their tricks.

**The Scenario:**

Picture this: you’ve just left a military bank like USAA or Navy Federal, feeling accomplished after a successful mission of depositing or withdrawing funds. Suddenly, you're approached by someone who seems genuinely distressed. They’re in a tight spot, can’t access their bank accounts, and need some cash for groceries. Sometimes, they even come with a little sidekick—a crying child to tug at your heartstrings. They humbly request a few bucks via the bank’s mobile app. 

You’re a kind-hearted soul, always ready to help a comrade in need. But wait! Before you can utter "Roger that," this seemingly innocent plea for help could be a trap.

**The Tactic:**

Here’s where the scammer's sleight of hand comes into play. You kindly open your banking app, ready to assist, and they reach for your phone. While you think they’re entering their details to complete the transfer, they’re actually transferring funds from all your accounts. And if that’s not enough drama, some reports say these scammers will distract you with engaging chatter about your travel plans while they apply for instant bank loans or use other payment apps to send your money to their own accounts.

**Avoiding the Ambush:**

1. **Guard Your Phone Like Fort Knox:** Never, and we mean never, hand over your phone to a stranger. It might seem like a small gesture of kindness, but it’s a red flag waving in the breeze.

2. **Embrace the Tactical Pause:** Scammers thrive on urgency and pressure. Take a breath, slow down, and think things through. A moment’s pause could save you from a financial ambush.

3. **Rally the Troops:** Share this intel with your military family and friends, especially during the holiday season when these scams are most active. 

4. **Report the Recon:** Spot a scam? Report it to your local police and state attorney general. And don’t forget to tell the folks at the FTC by visiting ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

Remember, while you're out there looking out for others, never forget to look out for yourself. Stay safe, stay savvy, and keep those scammers at bay!
