# Scamurai Website

This repository hosts the official Scamurai website — a simple, clean, and informative site built with Hugo.

Scamurai is a public service bot that raises awareness about online scams by posting timely scam alerts and educational content both on Mastodon and here as blog posts.

The website’s goal is to help people stay safe from scams and frauds by providing easy access to important scam information. It also serves as part of Shailendra Singh’s personal portfolio, showcasing his work in building automated and meaningful web projects.

The site is automatically updated and deployed using GitHub Actions whenever new scam alerts are published.
